Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop penning 'em
And I am not Hip-Hop and I'm just not Eminem

Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sending 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenalin shots, the penicillin could not get the illing to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
